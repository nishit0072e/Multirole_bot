A WiFi controlled obstacle avoiding and line following robot car built using NodeMCU ESP8266 is a DIY project that combines robotics, IoT, and artificial intelligence to create a fun and interactive robot car.

The NodeMCU ESP8266 is a small, Wi-Fi enabled microcontroller that can be programmed using the Arduino IDE. To build the robot car, you will need to connect the NodeMCU ESP8266 to various sensors, such as an ultrasonic sensor for obstacle avoidance and an infrared sensor for line following.

Once the sensors are connected, you can program the NodeMCU ESP8266 to use the sensor data to control the movement of the robot car. For example, if the ultrasonic sensor detects an obstacle, the NodeMCU ESP8266 can send a command to the motor controller to stop the robot car and change its direction. Similarly, if the infrared sensor detects a line, the NodeMCU ESP8266 can use the sensor data to control the motor controller and make the robot car follow the line.

To control the robot car using Wi-Fi, you can connect the NodeMCU ESP8266 to a Wi-Fi network and create a web interface using HTML and JavaScript. This web interface can be accessed from any device that is connected to the same Wi-Fi network, such as a smartphone or a laptop.

Using the web interface, you can send commands to the NodeMCU ESP8266 to control the movement of the robot car. For example, you can send a command to make the robot car move forward, backward, left, or right. You can also send commands to activate the obstacle avoidance or line following modes.

Overall, building a WiFi controlled obstacle avoiding and line following robot car using NodeMCU ESP8266 can be a challenging and rewarding project for DIY enthusiasts who are interested in robotics, IoT, and artificial intelligence. It can be a fun way to learn about these technologies and experiment with different programming techniques.
